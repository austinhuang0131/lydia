* On Kik, Line, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Slack, Telegram: You can type `start` to start up.
* On GroupMe, Skype for Business: Read the Command Reference.

<sup>Yes, there was a Facebook version, but Facebook temporarily banned my account 3 times and at the last time permanently banned it for literally nothing. The only way to get Metagon back on its original account is to provide them my ID, which is stupid, considering Facebook is one of the most privacy-invading company of all time. That account was only used for creating the bot, so I'm not planning to get it back to Facebook.</sup>

If the bot is stuck (Stopped responding / Not functioning properly) during any moment of your use, you can type `unstuck!!!` to effectively expel your trouble.

# Command Reference
In most situations you can just use the startup menu. However, if you're on GroupMe or Skype for Business, or you'd like to get results by only typing out 1 message, you must read the following.

# IMPORTANT! Per-Platform Issues
* There is **no keyboard mode** on <u>GroupMe and Skype for Business</u>, as well as <u>LINE Lite</u>. **Commands only.** That's because these platforms don't support buttons.
* On <u>Skype and Slack</u>, **a <kbd>  SPACE  </kbd> is required before `/` commands in the command mode**.
* To comply with <u>Kik</u> regulations, some commands are [not available](/kik-disabled) for good.
